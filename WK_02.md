# Week 2
## Learning Activities & Resources:
This week, I focused on learning Joomla CMS, including customizing templates and components. I spent time working on the full installation of Joomla on Mac using MAMP, and explored ways to modify templates, including the Contact Us page. Additionally, I began migrating my local Joomla setup to an AWS Lightsail instance.

I used the following resources:

For installing Joomla on Mac using MAMP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtwuHIefmAs

Joomla CMS documentation for template customization: https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/may-2024/how-to-customize-the-joomla-5-login-page

YouTube tutorials on Joomla templates: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk_4XIvoPA7O0xT_sYRKnTos

To customize the default contact component, I used:https://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?t=988261 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11817635/how-to-position-the-images-in-this-php-code . 

Create a Joomla Website with AWS Lightsail using: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbHGfjYi530 and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-quick-start-guide-joomla.html

Through these resources, I learned how to customize Joomla templates, particularly focusing on modifying the Contact Us page. I also gained knowledge on uploading and managing content effectively within Joomla, ensuring the site included pages, text, and images.

### Challenges faced during the week:

- Initially tried using CloudAccess.net for hosting, but I couldn't proceed because it asked for a 6-digit verification token that was sent to my phone number, but I never received it.
- I switched to [InfinityFree](https://forum.infinityfree.com/t/how-to-install-cms-like-wordpress-and-joomla/49314) for free hosting, which worked better but also faced challenges later.
- I then tried migrating my Joomla site from local (MAMP) to AWS Lightsail. I encountered difficulties, especially with editing the configuration.php file. While the migration process was partially complete, it was not fully functional.I referred to this resource:: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/migrate-your-wordpress-blog-to-amazon-lightsail.html
- Given that the website was relatively simple with just three pages, I decided it would be quicker to directly rebuild the site on AWS Lightsail rather than continue troubleshooting the migration process.


## Estimated Hours
I spent about 10 hours this week learning and practicing Joomla template customization, installing Joomla on local machines, working with AWS Lightsail, and troubleshooting various issues

## Content Insights:
Joomla Templates:
Site Template (Frontend Template): Controls the design, layout, and appearance of your website that users see.
Administrator Template (Backend Template): Affects the admin panel where you manage your site, without influencing the frontend.
- WordPress Overview:
WordPress as a CMS: It's a free, open-source web publishing application that can be used to build blogs, websites, and e-commerce stores.
Content Management: WordPress separates content management from presentation. Posts, pages, and media are stored in a database, making content management efficient.
- Post vs. Page:
Post: Time-sensitive, dynamic content, often shared on social media.
Page: Evergreen content that is static and doesn’t change over time, like About or Contact pages.
Media Library: Stores images and other media for easy reuse across posts and pages.
- How WordPress Works:
    WordPress serves as an interface between the database and the server, allowing visitors to access content like posts, pages, and media elements.
    When a new post or page is created, it is saved in the database, with its relationships to other elements also stored.
    WordPress allows you to install it on a local machine (using MAMP or DesktopServer) to test and learn without an internet connection.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- Through customizing Joomla templates, I enhanced my understanding of how CSS and HTML are used to adjust website layouts and designs. This skill is important for future web development projects, particularly in client work or building personal websites..

- While I encountered several challenges during the migration of my Joomla setup from local (MAMP) to AWS Lightsail, it provided me with invaluable learning experiences. The process highlighted the importance of planning ahead, particularly when deciding which hosting environment to use. This will be crucial in the future, as it’s essential to assess the available hosting options
