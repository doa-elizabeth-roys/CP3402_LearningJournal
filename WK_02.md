# Week 2
## Learning Activities & Resources:
This week, I focused on learning about Joomla CMS and working on customizing the templates and components. I spent time getting the full installation of Joomla on both Intel and M1 Macs using MAMP, and explored ways to modify templates and the Contact Us page.

Resources used:

I used the following resources:

For installing Joomla on Mac (Intel + M1) using MAMP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtwuHIefmAs
Joomla CMS documentation for template customization: https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/may-2024/how-to-customize-the-joomla-5-login-page
YouTube tutorials on Joomla templates: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk_4XIvoPA7O0xT_sYRKnTos

To customize the default contact component:https://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?t=988261 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11817635/how-to-position-the-images-in-this-php-code . 

I learned how to adjust the appearance and content of the Contact Us page by modifying the template files (default.php). To position an image on the right side of contact details, I used CSS adjustments like float: right in my layout files.

I also worked on learning how to upload and manage content effectively within Joomla and ensured the site contained pages, text, and images.

- Notes on Hosting:
Initially tried using CloudAccess.net for hosting, but I couldn't proceed because it asked for a 6-digit verification token that was sent to my phone number, but I never received it.
Later, I decided to use InfinityFree for free hosting instead, which worked better for my needs.

## Estimated Hours
I spent about 10 hours for week 2 learning and practicing these concepts.

## Content Insights:
Joomla Templates:
Site Template (Frontend Template): Controls the design, layout, and appearance of your website that users see.
Administrator Template (Backend Template): Affects the admin panel where you manage your site, without influencing the frontend.
- WordPress Overview:
WordPress as a CMS: It's a free, open-source web publishing application that can be used to build blogs, websites, and e-commerce stores.
Content Management: WordPress separates content management from presentation. Posts, pages, and media are stored in a database, making content management efficient.
- Post vs. Page:
Post: Time-sensitive, dynamic content, often shared on social media.
Page: Evergreen content that is static and doesnâ€™t change over time, like About or Contact pages.
Media Library: Stores images and other media for easy reuse across posts and pages.
- How WordPress Works:
WordPress serves as an interface between the database and the server, allowing visitors to access content like posts, pages, and media elements.
When a new post or page is created, it is saved in the database, with its relationships to other elements also stored.
WordPress allows you to install it on a local machine (using MAMP or DesktopServer) to test and learn without an internet connection.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
### Role of CSS and HTML in Customizing Web Templates:
By customizing the Joomla template, I gained a deeper understanding of how content management systems (CMS) work, especially in terms of modifying themes without affecting core functionality.

I also learned more about the role of CSS and HTML in customizing web templates. Understanding how to use these languages to adjust design elements and layouts will be valuable for future web development projects.

Understanding how to modify templates, adjust CSS for layout positioning, and manage content will be valuable in web development, especially when working with client projects or creating personal websites.
