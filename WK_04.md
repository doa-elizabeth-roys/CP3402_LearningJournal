# Week 4
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I revisited the process of migrating a WordPress site after attempting it in Week 2, where I faced some transfer issues and wasn’t able to complete the migration successfully. Initially, I didn’t know or use WP Migrate DB plugin for migrating, but watching the LinkedIn Learning course helped me understand the correct process and the tools I should use.

Additionally, I explored a video on how to run WordPress websites locally using Local by Flywheel. Although I didn’t use Flywheel for this practical, the video was helpful in giving me a better understanding of what Flywheel is and how it can simplify local development environments.

Resources I used:

## Estimated Hours
I spent about 7 hours this week learning, watching LinkedIn Learning videos, and practicing what I learned.

## Content Insights:
I learned the essential process for migrating a WordPress website from a local environment to a live server using WP Migrate DB Pro. The course covered important concepts like the differences between the free and Pro versions of the plugin, focusing on the push and pull functionalities. Push allows us to send a database from a local site to a remote server, and pull lets us bring a database from one site to another. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This experience emphasized the importance of understanding both local and live environments, especially when working with WordPress. I can see this skill being valuable in future roles, particularly in web development or website management. Being able to manage the migration process efficiently will be a key skill in my career.
