# Week 1
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I completed the LinkedIn Learning course "Introduction to Web Design and Development" and made notes of it. I learned about web and native apps, how clients and servers interact, the importance of testing websites on different devices and browsers, and key concepts in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. I also spent time setting up WordPress locally and Docker for development, and explored GitHub Pages for deploying websites.

## Estimated Hours
I spent about 8 hours this week learning and practicing these concepts.

## Content Insights
* Web Clients & Servers: I learned how web browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, act as clients that send requests to servers for webpage files. This is important to understand the basic structure of web communication.
* Native vs Web Apps: Native apps are designed for specific operating systems (e.g., iOS or Android), require installation, and work offline, whereas web apps are accessed via browsers and need an internet connection to work. Web apps are easier to build and maintain.
* Testing & Browsers: Testing websites on multiple physical devices and browsers (like Firefox, Chrome, and Edge) is essential for ensuring good user experience.
* UX/UI Design: UX professionals focus on overall user experience, while UI designers work on the visual design. I also learned about the prototyping process and tools like Figma and Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator.
* I enjoyed exploring GitHub Pages. It was exciting to see how easy it is to deploy a website after writing the code. It made me realize the power of version control and easy deployment tools for web development.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
* Learning about Docker and GitHub Pages gave me a better understanding of modern web development workflows, which will be useful in my future job roles.
