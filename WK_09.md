# Week 9
## Learning Activities 
This week, I participated in both the lecture and practical sessions. I watched few videos from LinkedIn Learning to which is about SASS. 
Additionally, I worked on my group project.

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 3-4 hours this week learning and working on Sass.

## Content Insights

* Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It provides additional features like variables, mixins, nesting, and inheritance, making CSS more powerful and easier to maintain.

* Variables: 
   - Simplify CSS by storing reusable values (like colors or fonts) in variables.
   - Makes global updates easier and more efficient.

* Nesting Styles  
   - Organize related styles inside each other, keeping your code more readable.
   - Use nesting sparingly to avoid overly specific selectors.

* @extend Method
   - Allows one class to inherit styles from another, reducing redundancy and keeping the CSS concise.

* Mixins
   - Reusable blocks of CSS, like functions in programming.
   - Can accept parameters for flexibility and even have default values.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
During my practical work, I first tried to use Grunt, but I ran into installation errors even though I followed the instructions. It was a bit frustrating, but it pushed me to try Gulp instead. Thankfully, Gulp worked without any issues, and I was able to continue with the task. This experience taught me the value of being flexible and persistent when troubleshooting tools.

After finishing the practical, I took a closer look at Sass. I thought it wouldnâ€™t be much different from regular CSS, but I quickly saw how Sass made my stylesheets more organized and manageable. It allowed me to break down my CSS into smaller chunks using variables, mixins, and nesting, which made everything look cleaner and easier to maintain. I could definitely see the long-term benefits of using Sass in future projects.
