# Week 5
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I completed my assignment and watched lecture recordings. I also watched some videos from LinkedIn Learning and YouTube tutorials related to WordPress child themes.

- LinkedIn Learning - [WordPress: Building Child Themes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-child-themes-3/set-up-a-code-editor?u=2223545)
- WordPress how to Customize with a Child Theme Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ejtEEqxLw
- How to copy files from host to Docker container: [How to copy files from host to Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/cp/)
- Add A Custom WordPress Child Theme Thumbnail : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k27am4ofH6w

## Estimated Hours
I spent about 5 hours this week learning and completing the practical.

## Content Insights
- A child theme allows you to safely customize a WordPress site without modifying the parent theme.
- It involves two main files: style.css (for styling) and functions.php (for PHP customizations).
- The child theme inherits all the styles and functionality of the parent theme but can override or extend them using style.css
- To ensure your custom styles work, you must enqueue the parent theme’s stylesheet in your child theme's functions.php.
- Using wp_enqueue_style() ensures the child theme inherits the parent theme’s styles while allowing you to add custom styles.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
When I started doing the practical, I watched a few videos and reviewed child theme documentation. I learned that the changes I need to make are in style.css and functions.php, but initially, I wasn’t sure where to find these files. Many tutorials I found either used plugins or FTP tools like FileZilla, which didn’t match my environment.

After further exploration, I realized I had set up WordPress using Docker, and figured out where to place the files. However, after adding the customizations, the changes didn’t show up. I then discovered the docker cp command, which copies files between containers, and once I applied that, the changes appeared on the website.

Building a child theme seemed simple at first, but these little details—like figuring out where to place the files and using Docker to apply changes—took much more time than I anticipated. However, this experience taught me the importance of understanding Docker and how different tools interact when setting up a development environment.
