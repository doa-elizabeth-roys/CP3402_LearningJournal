# Week 6
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I watched the lecture recordings, completed the LinkedIn Learning course "Agile at Work: Driving Productive Agile Meetings" and made notes of it. 
I also spent time investigating DigitalOcean as a hosting platform, which is free through the GitHub Education Pack. 
Additionally, I focused on getting organized with my team. I connected with everyone on LinkedIn, joined our Slack group, and logged into GitHub to set up our team repository. We copied the Trello template, made it public, and added all team members. We then completed the Group Agreement & Contacts section, discussing roles and expectations. Finally, we integrated GitHub and Trello with Slack to ensure smooth updates and communication throughout the project.

## Content Insights
- Team Meetings: In a team meeting, it's important that everyone contributes their updates, focusing on what they’ve accomplished, what they plan to do next, and any challenges they’re facing. Also, need to makes sure that the meetings stays on track and doesn’t go over time.

- Planning for Success: When planning tasks for the team, it's key to collaborate and be transparent. Everyone should be involved in breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones and estimating how long each task will take. The goal is to keep the work flexible and adaptable.

- Showcasing Progress: Regular reviews of the work are important to make sure the project is on the right track. These reviews give the team a chance to show clients what’s been accomplished and gather feedback to make sure everything is aligned with expectations.

- Continuous Improvement: Regular feedback is essential for improving how the team works. Activities like daily check-ins, reviews, and reflection meetings help the team identify issues and find ways to improve their processes.

- Avoiding Multitasking: Multitasking can lower productivity. It's more effective to focus on one task at a time, complete it, and then move on to the next. Keeping team activities focused and minimizing distractions helps the team stay engaged and get more done in less time.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
* I’ve realized the importance of stand-up meetings in both team projects and job settings. Stand-ups provide a structured way for teams to communicate, align on goals, and quickly identify obstacles.The main purpose is for team members to share what they’ve done, what they plan to do, and any blockers they’re facing. These meetings, while brief, ensure that everyone is on the same page and that progress is being made toward project goals.
