# Week 3 Learning Journal
## Learning Activities & Resources:
This week, I started working on creating a WordPress site similar to the Joomla site I built last week. Based on the feedback I received on the Joomla site, I modified the WordPress site by adding call-to-action buttons. This was an important update, as it enhances the design and helps in user interaction, which wasn’t very clear in the Joomla version.

I spent time familiarizing myself with WordPress and its features, including setting up pages, posts, and media. Additionally, I worked on customizing the theme and implementing plugins like Contact Form 7 for forms. A key focus this week was getting more comfortable with theme customization, including minor design changes like header/footer tweaks.

For the group formation task, I used questions such as:

How do you usually approach group projects? Do you prefer to take charge, or do you like to collaborate with others?
Are you comfortable working under tight deadlines, or do you prefer to start early and pace the project?
Are you open to meeting outside of scheduled class times, if necessary, to complete tasks or brainstorm?
How do you prefer to communicate with team members—via email, messaging apps, or meetings?
What are your expectations for how the team should work together throughout this project?

One peer shared that they prefer collaboration in group projects, as it enhances understanding and leads to better results. They like to start tasks early but balance it with a focus on quality. They’re open to working outside scheduled class times if needed, although they mentioned that late-night work can sometimes be less efficient. For communication, they prefer using Slack, Discord, or email but are open to other tools. They expect the team to maintain clear communication and encourage helping each other when needed to ensure smooth collaboration.

## Content Insights:

A key takeaway from this week was learning about child themes in WordPress. While I have not yet implemented one, I now understand that using a child theme allows you to customize a theme without modifying its core files. This prevents customizations from being lost when the parent theme is updated. It’s an essential practice for WordPress developers and helps ensure that modifications are retained over time.

Additionally, I hosted my WordPress site using Amazon Lightsail, where I added images and other media content to the site. I focused on understanding how to manage themes and content within WordPress.

The group-formation exercise was particularly insightful. Through interviewing peers, I learned how critical it is to align expectations and communication preferences early in a group project. Understanding whether team members prefer to collaborate frequently or work more independently, and identifying preferred methods of communication (email, messaging apps, meetings), will be key to ensuring effective teamwork during our major group project.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

This week, I realized that working with WordPress, especially using child themes, is essential for anyone aiming to be a WordPress developer or designer. I'm now more confident that mastering WordPress, its themes, pages and plugins, will make me a more flexible developer. I’ve learned how to structure and customize themes better, and I plan to keep practicing these skills to improve my abilities.

However, I still need more practice with child themes and advanced CSS customizations, so I’ll keep focusing on these areas in the coming weeks.

In addition, the group formation interviews were a helpful exercise in understanding what makes a good team dynamic. The exercise helped me see how people’s working styles and communication preferences affect group performance. From these insights, I learned that establishing clear expectations early on and encouraging open communication can greatly improve group efficiency and overall project success.
