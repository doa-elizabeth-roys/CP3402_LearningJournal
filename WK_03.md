# Week 3 Learning Journal
## Learning Activities & Resources:
This week, I started working on creating a WordPress site similar to the Joomla site I built last week. Based on the feedback I received on the Joomla site, I modified the WordPress site by adding call-to-action buttons. This was an important update, as it enhances the design and helps in user interaction, which wasn’t very clear in the Joomla version.

I spent time familiarizing myself with WordPress and its features, including setting up pages, posts, and media. Additionally, I worked on customizing the theme and implementing plugins like Contact Form 7 for forms. A key focus this week was getting more comfortable with theme customization, including minor design changes like header/footer tweaks.

## Content Insights:

The key takeaway this week was the importance of child themes in WordPress. Though I have not yet applied them, I learned that using child themes allows you to customize a theme without modifying the core files, which helps prevent losing changes when updates occur.  This is particularly useful because updates to the parent theme won’t overwrite any customizations made in a child theme. This enables flexibility in development and ensures customizations are retained.

In addition, I focused on understanding the basic theme management process in WordPress, including the importance of keeping media content like images within the WordPress site itself and external resources like videos and audio in services like Amazon S3.
The group-formation exercise was particularly insightful. Through interviewing peers, I learned how critical it is to align expectations and communication preferences early in a group project. Understanding whether team members prefer to collaborate frequently or work more independently, and identifying preferred methods of communication (email, messaging apps, meetings), will be key to ensuring effective teamwork during our major group project.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

This week, I realized that working with WordPress, particularly using child themes, is crucial for anyone working as a WordPress developer or designer. 
I feel more confident that mastering WordPress and understanding its ecosystem (such as themes, plugins, and child themes) will make me a more versatile developer. I now understand how to structure and customize WordPress themes efficiently, and I plan to continue practicing with these tools to improve my technical skills.

However, I recognize that I need more practice in implementing child themes and advanced CSS customizations, so I will continue to focus on these areas in the coming weeks.
In addition, the group formation interviews were a helpful exercise in understanding what makes a good team dynamic. The exercise helped me see how people’s working styles and communication preferences affect group performance. From these insights, I learned that establishing clear expectations early on and encouraging open communication can greatly improve group efficiency and overall project success.
