# Week 8
## Learning Activities 
This week, I participated in both the lecture and practical sessions, with a particular focus on the group assignment which involved setting up deployment using GitHub Actions. Additionally, I watched videos from LinkedIn Learning to further understand the Underscores theme in WordPress.

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 7 hours this week learning and working on the assignment.

## Content Insights

* Modular System in WordPress**: WordPress uses a modular approach where different components (like header, footer, and content) are handled by separate template files, making it easier to manage and update each part of a page.

* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle**: By using common files (e.g., `header.php`, `footer.php`), WordPress ensures that repetitive elements are not coded multiple times, streamlining maintenance and updates.

* URL and Post Retrieval**: WordPress converts human-readable URLs into a post ID (e.g., `?p=2726`), retrieves the corresponding content from the database, and loads the relevant template (e.g., `single.php` for individual posts).

* Underscores Theme**: Underscores is a starter theme that provides templates like `index.php`, `single.php`, and `archive.php`, and serves as a base for building custom WordPress themes.

* Using Sass for Styles**: Instead of editing `style.css` directly, Sass is employed to generate the CSS. The main file, `style.scss`, imports partial files responsible for different design aspects, such as colors, typography, and layout. This allows for cleaner, more organized styling.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning GitHub Actions has been valuable in building my problem-solving skills. Figuring it out on my own has made me more confident in tackling new tools and technologies. This experience will help me learn more independently in the future, which is useful both in university and for my career. Mastering such tools adds to my technical skill set, making me more employable in tech roles where automation and continuous integration are important.

## Hypothesis
I believe that combining video-based learning (from a reliable source, such as educational videos) with hands-on practice will result in a deeper understanding and faster problem-solving ability, especially when learning a new technical skill.

- Test Method:

To test this hypothesis, I focused on setting up deployment using GitHub Actions. The following steps outline the process I followed:

- Initial Attempt:
I started by reading the official GitHub Actions documentation to set up deployment. Despite following the steps, I encountered several errors and confusion. Some links in it didnâ€™t work, and there were ambiguities in the instructions, particularly regarding the deployment file.

- Secondary Attempt:
I tried alternative resources, but they were structured differently, leading to further confusion.

- Third Attempt (Experiment):
I watched a tutorial video that demonstrated the step-by-step process for GitHub Actions. I then applied what I learned to a real-world project while following the tutorial.

- Testing:
During implementation, I encountered minor errors, but the video helped me understand the process better, allowing me to fix them quickly. I tracked how long it took to complete the setup with and without the video.

* Results:

- Speed of Learning:
After watching the video, I moved faster than in previous attempts, as the visual explanation clarified complex steps.

- Problem-Solving:
The video helped me understand the logic behind the deployment process, making troubleshooting easier and quicker.

- Success:
I successfully set up GitHub Actions deployment, with the video increasing my speed and confidence in resolving issues independently.

The results support my hypothesis that video-based learning, combined with hands-on practice, accelerates learning.
