# Week 10
## Learning Activities 
This week, I attended both the lecture and practical sessions. Most of my focus was on our group project and presentation. I worked closely with my team to prepare our slides and rehearse the presentation. 

I did several rounds of presentation rehearsals. After each round, I made a few corrections. One time, my face didn’t show up on Zoom because I chose the wrong screen sharing option — I fixed that in the next run. I also made sure to clearly hand over to the next speaker by saying things like “Now, [Name] will talk about…,” which helped the presentation flow better. In one rehearsal, I noticed I had the notes section showing on the slides, which was distracting, so I corrected that too. These rehearsals really helped me feel more confident and polished for the final presentation.

## Resources: 
I watched some parts of the [WordPress: Developing Secure Sites](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-developing-secure-sites/welcome?u=2223545) course on LinkedIn Learning. It covered useful topics like how to back up and restore a WordPress site, and how to keep everything up to date.


## Estimated Hours
Lecture and practical: 4 hours

Group project work and presentation prep: not exactly sure, but it took a lot of time across the week

## Content Insights
- Backups: I learned how to use the UpdraftPlus plugin to schedule backups and store them remotely (e.g., Dropbox, Amazon S3).

- Restoring a site: I now know how to restore a site using FTP and phpMyAdmin, which is useful if anything goes wrong.

- Staying up to date: Keeping WordPress core, themes, and plugins updated is important for security. I also learned about a plugin called Updates Notifier that sends email alerts for updates.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- This week really helped me improve my WordPress skills, especially when it comes to keeping a site secure and running smoothly. Understanding how to back up, restore, and update a site is key for maintaining a secure website. 
- Working on the group presentation also helped me improve how I explain technical things to others — which is a useful skill in any workplace. Overall, these experiences have strengthened my technical skills and my ability to work collaboratively, both of which are essential in the field of web development.
