# Week 7
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I watched the lecture recordings, completed the LinkedIn Learning course "Agile at Work: Driving Productive Agile Meetings" and made notes of it. 
I also spent time investigating DigitalOcean as a hosting platform, which is free through the GitHub Education Pack. 
Additionally, I focused on getting organized with my team. I connected with everyone on LinkedIn, joined our Slack group, and logged into GitHub to set up our team repository. We copied the Trello template, made it public, and added all team members. We then completed the Group Agreement & Contacts section, discussing roles and expectations. Finally, we integrated GitHub and Trello with Slack to ensure smooth updates and communication throughout the project.

## Estimated Hours
I spent 6 hours this week learning and practicing.

## Content Insights:

* Displaying Text: The echo statement is the go-to for outputting text or variable values to the browser. It's simple and key for interacting with users.

* Single vs. Double Quotes: Single quotes are for literal text (no parsing of variables), while double quotes allow for variables to be used directly inside the string. This makes it easier to work with dynamic content.

* Variables and Data Types: Variables in PHP are flexible. No need to declare their type.

* Arrays: Arrays let us store multiple values in one variable. Indexed arrays are ordered and accessed by their position (starting from 0), which helps manage a list of items easily.

* Loops: for and while loops let you repeat tasks until a condition is met. foreach is perfect for going through all elements in an array, making it ideal for handling lists or collections.

* Conditionals - if/else: If/else statements let us make decisions in code based on certain conditions. It’s a basic but powerful tool to control the flow of execution.

* Include - Common Header and Footer: Using include helps to keep  code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). By having shared elements like headers and footers in separate files, we only need to update them in one place.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
* Learning PHP: This week, I started learning PHP, and while it was a new language for me, many of the concepts like while, for, and if/else were already familiar from other programming languages. It turned out to be easier than I expected because I could watch videos and refer to helpful websites with PHP examples.
* PHP for Job Opportunities: Knowing PHP will definitely open up opportunities, particularly in roles that involve working with server-side scripts. Understanding PHP also helps in debugging and optimizing websites, which is valuable for both front-end and back-end developers. As I continue learning, I can see how PHP can be useful in web development projects.

## Team Project Summary
This week, we held two key meetings where we reviewed the project requirements, clarified submission expectations, and discussed important considerations before starting the work. We also focused on hosting options and resource allocation, deciding to use Wordmove to aid in deployment across different environments.

One of our team members set up two AWS Lightsail instances—one for production and the other for stagging. This setup will help us manage separate environments, ensuring smoother development and deployment processes.

The next step is to finalize the device setup in the upcoming meeting, ensuring that everyone has the necessary tools and environment in place to proceed with the project tasks.
