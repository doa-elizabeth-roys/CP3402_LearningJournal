# CP3402 Learning Journal

This repository serves as a learning journal for my Content Management Systems subject. It captures the activities, resources, insights, and reflections that I gain throughout the process. The journal is intended to track my progress, document what Iâ€™ve learned, and provide a reference to help reinforce key concepts.
